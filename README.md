# MovieRegistry For Windows

### MovieRegistryForWindows is a Universal Windows Application, created for the Mobile Applications course at FMI, Sofia. 
#### It is a Windows version of my MovieRegistry project, first written in Ruby https://github.com/betrakiss/MovieRegistry
#### It is not yet ready for the Windows Store.

##### With MovieRegistry, you can now save all the data for your favourite movies in a small database.

You can
  - make entries when you watch a movie or a TV Show
  - check if you have watched a movie
  - check what is the last episode of a TV Show, you're watching
  - edit entries
  - check the dates at which you have watched something
  - can be used by multiple users
  - aaaaand be notified, when a new episode of your favourite show is up!

  
  
### Special thanks to IMDB and TVDB for the data.

Hope you enjoy it! :smile:
